LinkedIn Learning:
    -   TS Syntax
    -   TS into existing application

# Intro:
TS is statically typed (JS – dynamically typed)
    -	Statically typed meaning: Its type cannot be changed and its type is determined at the compiling time itself.
    -	Dynamically typed: type of variable will only be determined at the time of runtime and not during the compiling time. 
        -- **NOTE:** compile time (program code to machine code) and runtime (is when the code is actually running on the computers hardware)
TS is easily understandable by the peers.


# To run the typescript:
run "tsc -watch" or "tsc -w" in the terminal. 

# Note:
Before running the above command, navigate into the appropriate directory.
